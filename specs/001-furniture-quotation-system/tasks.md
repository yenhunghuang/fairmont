# Tasks: 家具報價單系統 (Furniture Quotation System)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-furniture-quotation-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: TDD approach required per constitution (測試優先開發). Tests are included in each user story phase.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/` for FastAPI, `frontend/` for Streamlit
- See plan.md for detailed project structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Builds on US1 upload/parse infrastructure but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Builds on US1 parse infrastructure but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Builds on US1 quotation infrastructure but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (per constitution TDD requirement)
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Backend before frontend
- Core implementation before UI integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all contract tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for POST /api/upload endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_upload_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for POST /api/parse/{document_id} endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_parse_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for GET /api/parse/{document_id}/result endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_parse_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for POST /api/quotation endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_export_api.py"
# ... etc

# Launch all unit tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for pdf_parser service (Gemini integration) in backend/tests/unit/test_pdf_parser.py"
Task: "Unit test for image_extractor service (PyMuPDF) in backend/tests/unit/test_image_extractor.py"
Task: "Unit test for excel_generator service (openpyxl) in backend/tests/unit/test_excel_generator.py"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all model creation tasks together:
Task: "Create BOQItem Pydantic model per data-model.md in backend/app/models/boq_item.py"
Task: "Create SourceDocument Pydantic model per data-model.md in backend/app/models/source_document.py"
Task: "Create Quotation Pydantic model per data-model.md in backend/app/models/quotation.py"
Task: "Create ProcessingTask Pydantic model per data-model.md in backend/app/models/processing_task.py"
Task: "Create ExtractedImage Pydantic model per data-model.md in backend/app/models/extracted_image.py"
Task: "Create API response models in backend/app/models/responses.py"

# Launch all utility tasks together:
Task: "Implement error handling utilities in backend/app/utils/errors.py"
Task: "Implement file manager utility in backend/app/utils/file_manager.py"
Task: "Implement input validators in backend/app/utils/validators.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1 - MVP)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2 - after US1 foundation ready)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P2 - after US1 foundation ready)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (P3 - after US1 foundation ready)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD per constitution)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All user-facing messages must be in 繁體中文
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
